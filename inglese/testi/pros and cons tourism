Nowadays, it seems that tourism has become the most important sector of the global economy, the tourism industry is increasing, affected by new technological
advancements. As well as other industries, it has pros and cons, and they will be illustrated in this essay.
Firstly, tourism is positive for the economy, people claim that tourism may provide a significant source of income for local communities 
and will lead to job opportunities. However developed countries can become very crowded, and this may lead to the development of commercialism. 
An example is the growing prevalence of high-priced souvenirs sold around major tourist destinations. Further it causes damages, recently, for example, 
there are reports of tourists damaging artistic monuments for fun.
Another point to remember is that tourism is positive for the growth of a country: many countries offer incentives that allow companies to invest 
their money in forms of infrastructure necessary for promoting tourism in the country. On the other hand, it may create a clash between cultures 
and cause the destruction of existing communities.
In addition, it promotes international connections, creates new friendships, and build relationships between different countries. 
However, the seasonal nature of tourism, that has its peak during summer, provides temporary jobs that do not ensure stability for workers, 
that during the off-season must find another solution to maintain themselves.
In conclusion, tourism can be beneficial, or can have drawbacks; profound changes occur in the country in both cases. 
I believe that the only way to make the advantages greater than the disadvantages is to respect the traditions, culture, and people of that country.
